### Synopsis

- Our Client:
  - San Mateo County Mosquito and Vector Control District
- Our Client’s business:
  - The San Mateo County Mosquito and Vector Control District actively reduces vector populations of disease-carrying pests, employing a science-based approach of integrated vector management. In addition, the district is engaged in ongoing research and development initiatives to enhance its capabilities in safeguarding public health
- Our Client’s “problem” to be solved:
  - The client currently manages inventory using a manual paper-based system, leading to increased workload and extended processing times.
- Our proposed solution:

    - Enhances the overall control and visibility of the client’s inventory assets.
    - QR Scanning Integration:
    - Expedites the checkout process for a quicker and more user-friendly experience.
    - Enables swift access and updates to inventory information.

  - Our team's solution stands out due to its integration of both electronic inventory management and QR scanning capabilities. This dual functionality provides a comprehensive approach to the client's challenge, ensuring not only a more streamlined inventory control system but also a user-friendly method for item transactions.
